### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### About me
I'm a new programmer and am currently learning data science. I recently finished a bootcamp at HyperionDev where I learnt:
- Python and SQL
- Object-oriented programming
- Data manipulation, visualisation, and analysis
- Machine learning

I am currently a data analyst trainee at Digital Futures, where I am sharpening my coding, data analysis, and machine learning skills to become a proficient data analyst.
