### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### About me
I'm a new programmer and am currently learning data science. I recently finished a bootcamp at HyperionDev where I learnt:
- Python and SQL
- Object-oriented programming
- Data manipulation, visualisation, and analysis
- Machine learning

I am currently trying to land a role in the data science field using my new-learned skills and passion in data science.
